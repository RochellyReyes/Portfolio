A bit of context, this project focused on a location we, the cohort, wanted to visit. In the website, we included a home page, activities and accommodations page, and a contact us page. This was definitely one of the hardest projects as I did not previously have much experience with websites so I am proud of the functionality and it looks pretty nice for my first website. Web page is CSS and HTML validated by W3C Markup Validation Services.",
